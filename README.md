CUDA shift will perform a ceaser cipher shift on your GPU. The program will start on your CPU then move over to your GPU after all data is collected from the user.


Please note because this program is written in CUDA you will need to have an Nvidia GPU(Device) in your system. You can see if you have an Nvidia GPU by running the command nvidia-smi from your CLI and see if you have a valid CUDA version.
